# HackathonFall23-Matthew-Marchman-Tinina-Dowell
GPC hackathon for team G7

-This was a project built by Matthew Marchman, and Tinina Dowell for a Hackathon put on by Kennesaw 
State University. 

-The sponsor for our challange Was Genuine Parts Company (GPC)

-The challange was to create an algorithm that puts boxes into a shipping container, and a pallet, and a box truck in the most optimal way possible.

-Our team started with the most simple senerio which was loading boxes that were the same size into the shipping container.

-We used the iterative method to continue to add more features onto the product, and although our product was not the most optimul, nor advanced, we got to a point during this compitition, where we had a functioning model that
were able to show the judges.
